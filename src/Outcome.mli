type atomic_val = Bool of bool | Int of int

(** Represents a result trace (or the absence thereof).  *)

type valuation
(** A valuation maps set/relation names to the tuples they contain. *)

type state
(** A state is either a plain state, or the target of a lasso from the last
    state of the trace. *)

type states = state list
(** Nonempty, ordered sequence of states.  *)

type t = private {
  trace : states option;
  nbvars : int;  (** number of Booleans used  *)
  conversion_time : Mtime.span;
  analysis_time : Mtime.span;
}
(** An outcome represents the result of an analysis. It is either [None],
    meaning there is no resulting trace, or it is [Some _] in wihch case it
    carries a nonempty, ordered sequence of states, with at least one being the
    target of a loop ("lasso" step). *)

val no_trace : int -> Mtime.span -> Mtime.span -> t
(** Represents the absence of trace (so usually: UNSAT). *)

(** The list must be nonempty and must contain at least one lasso target. *)

val loop_is_present : states -> bool
