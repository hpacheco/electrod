(** An instance is a set of relations whose value is a fixed tuple set. *)

type t
(** Virtually: a map between relation names and sets of tuples. *)

val empty : t
(** Constructor. *)

val add : Name.t -> Tuple_set.t -> t -> t
(** Adds an association to the instance. 
    The name must not be in the instance already. *)

val mem : Name.t -> t -> bool
(** Checks whether a name is already bound in the map. *)

(** {1 Accessors}*)

val get_exn : Name.t -> t -> Tuple_set.t
(** May raise Not_found. {b IT MAY BE BETTER TO RETURN AN EXACT SCOPE OR EVEN 
    A RELATION (TO BE DECIDED WHEN INSTANCES ARE USED IN THE TRANSLATION)} *)

val get : Name.t -> t -> Tuple_set.t option
(** May rather return None. {b IT MAY BE BETTER TO RETURN AN EXACT SCOPE OR EVEN 
    A RELATION (TO BE DECIDED WHEN INSTANCES ARE USED IN THE TRANSLATION)} *)

val to_list : t -> (Name.t * Tuple_set.t) list
(** Returns the map as an association list. {b IT MAY BE BETTER TO RETURN AN
    EXACT SCOPE OR EVEN A RELATION (TO BE DECIDED WHEN INSTANCES ARE USED IN THE
    TRANSLATION)} *)
