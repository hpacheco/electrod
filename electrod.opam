synopsis: "Formal analysis for the Electrod formal pivot language"
description:
  "Electrod is a model finder that takes as input a model expressed in a mixture of relational first-order logic (RFOL) over bounded domains and linear temporal logic (LTL) over an unbounded time horizon. Then it compiles the model to a problem for a solver (currently the NuSMV and nuXmv model-checkers). Electrod is mainly meant to be used as a backend for the Alloy Analyzer 6."
